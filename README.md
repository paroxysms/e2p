optimized, current benchmark is ~0.14s for a 1080x720 image, including saving. a better benchmark is probably possible, but this is as far as ill go as its actually slightly faster than the python equivalent (but significantly more complex due to the limitations of rust computer vision libraries)

this is just a Rust recode of the equivalent project written in python, it can be found [here](https://github.com/fuenwang/Equirec2Perspec)
