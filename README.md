optimized, current benchmark is 0.3s for a 1080x720 image, including saving, but it uses deprecated functions due to laziness to understand how to use cowarray

ive reached my target, but i think a better benchmark is most certainly possible with decent optimizations

this is just a Rust recode of the equivalent project written in python, it can be found [here](https://github.com/fuenwang/Equirec2Perspec)
